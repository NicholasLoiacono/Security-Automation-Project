## PCAP Analyzer

### Project Description
PCAP Analyzer is a Python tool that automates the extraction and analysis of data from PCAP (Packet Capture) files. It helps cybersecurity professionals quickly identify and analyze network traffic anomalies, potential threats, and suspicious activities.

### Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PCAP-Analyzer.git
   cd PCAP-Analyzer
2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install scapy pandas

### Usage Instructions
Place your PCAP file in the same directory as 'pcap_analyzer.py'.
Run the tool:
python pcap_analyzer.py

3. The output will be saved in 'report.csv'.
